Bike3S offers us the possibility to\nexecute situations using different infrastructure configurations, user models and balancing algorithms.\n\n\nThe motivation of this project is to search strategies to balance the system resources using systems, typically, based on incentives, which recommend the users to rent or return a bike in a certain station to contribute to the system balancing\n\n\nHere you'll find all the necessary documentation to use and develop new features in Bike3S.\n\n\nFor Users\n\n\nIf you just want to run the simulator with preconfigured user behaviors in different cities around the world, just follow the next guide:\n\n\nUsers Guide\n\n\nFor Developers\n\n\nIf you are a developer or researcher and wants to create new things for the simulator, you should start here.

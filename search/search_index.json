Bike sharing systems allow citizens to move between different places in an simple and economical way. Bike3S offers us the possibility to execute situations using different infrastructure configurations, user models and balancing algorithms. The motivation of this project is to search strategies to balance the system resources using systems, typically, based on incentives, which recommend the users to rent or return a bike in a certain station to contribute to the system balancing Here you'll find all the necessary documentation to use and develop new features in Bike3S. For Users If you just want to run the simulator with preconfigured user behaviors in different cities around the world, just follow the next guide: Users Guide For Developers If you are a developer or researcher and wants to create new things for the simulator, you should start here. With this guide you will learn to Configure and prepare your system for development. Configure you're favorite IDE. Learn the architecture and fundamentals of the simulator to implement new things. Implement different users behaviors. Implement your own recommendation system. And more...

The package manager NPM is also required but is usually bundled with the Node.js installer. Getting Started for Development This project is development environment agnostic. You can use an IDE or just the command line. General overview of the software architecture The project is separated in two main parts: a backend and a frontend . The backend is related to all the simulation logic and is implemented in Java. The folder /backend-bikesurbanfleets contains this part of the project. The frontend is related to all the GUI and data analysis of the simulations. It is implemented in TypeScript, using Angular and Electron. The folder /frontend-bikesurbanfleets contains this part of the project. Setup First of all, be sure you have all the Prerequisites installed and working in your system. Execute this in the project directory. git clone https://github.com/stimonm/Bike3S.git cd Bike3S npm install node fuse configure:dev Execute Frontend You can now execute your program and try it just by running: node fuse build:frontend Execute Backend TODO - Execute Backend users generator and Backend Users Core example Build From Command Line To build the backend execute: node fuse build:dev-backend To build the frontend and execute the GUI: node fuse build:frontend To build all the project: node fuse build:dist Distribute To distribute an executable or installer for your OS, just run npm run distribute Executables are generated in build/dist/ Fundamentals TODO - Link to pdf developer manual","title":"Developers Guide"},{"location":"developers_guide/#prerequisites","text":"JDK 1.8 Maven 3.5 Node.js 8.9 Git Please make sure that all the binaries are registered in your PATH.

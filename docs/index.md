# Bike3S Introduction

Bike3S is a simulator created for the purpose of testing different behaviors in real bike sharing systems. 
Bike sharing systems allow citizens to move between different places in an simple and economical way. Bike3S offers us the possibility to
execute situations using different infrastructure configurations, user models and balancing algorithms.

The motivation of this project is to search strategies to balance the system resources using systems, typically, based on incentives, which recommend the users to rent or return a bike in a certain station to contribute to the system balancing

Here you'll find all the necessary documentation to use and develop new features in Bike3S.

## For Users

If you just want to run the simulator with preconfigured user behaviors in different cities around the world, just follow the next guide:

[Users Guide](users_guide.md)

## For Developers

If you are a developer or researcher and wants to create new things for the simulator, you should start here. With this guide you will learn to

* Configure and prepare your system for development.
* Configure you're favorite IDE.
* Learn the architecture and fundamentals of the simulator to implement new things.
* Implement different users behaviors.
* Implement your own recommendation system.

And more...
